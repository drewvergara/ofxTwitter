ofxTwitter
==========

OpenFrameworks Addon - ofxTwitter
Created by Andrew Vergara

The original addon was created by Edric Stanley on 10/12/10 which was adapted from code by Paul Shen.
I have updated the addon to use the most recent version of ofxHttpUtils addon. https://github.com/arturoc/ofxHttpUtils

This addon is dependent on these other addons:
- ofxHttpUtils
- ofxXmlSettings
- ofxThread (deprecated in 007, you can use ofThread instead)



Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any feedback!
